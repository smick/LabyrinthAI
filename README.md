# LabyrinthAI

LabyrinthAI provides a visualization of genetic algorithms solving a maze. Users can interact with the application through a graphical interface, selecting different algorithms, maze dimensions, and other parameters.

## Features

- Multiple genetic algorithms to choose from.
- Real-time visualization of solutions traversing the maze.
- Configurable population size, selection, crossover, and mutation methods.
- Ability to generate new mazes.
